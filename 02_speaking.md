I enjoy sharing stories and insights from my adventures in DevSecOps transformation and organisational change for the benefit of protecting customer data. I like my talks to be accessible to everyone, so they tend not to be technical and focus on the social skills required to make an impact. I cover topics such as Change Management, Leadership, Influence and Building Great Teams. Below are some of the links and presentations I have given in the past. If you feel the content of my talks would benefit your speaking event or organisation - lets chat!

This was an interesting conference, it was shared with physical security and fire safety exhibitors, and was busy. It was nice to have all the seats filled and an opportunity to practice having my microphone and clicky-clicky fail during the talk.

## November 2019 - Bristech - Bristol
### Security Cultures & Cheap Talk

In this talk I implore that need for shared language and education when it comes to application security. I give a 101 on risk terminology, how CVSS works and why its lets about the score but the narrative of the questions. I also discuss developer threat modelling, a way of fitting in threat modelling into a sprint cadence.

The Bristech conferences were some of the most well organized conferences I have been too, and I got a nice Bristech T-Shirt for speaking.

## September 2019 - TechExeter - Exeter

My first "proper" conference presentation where I had a lecture theatre and a filled room. I discuss running an AppSec project at the hydro and how security is a people problem.
