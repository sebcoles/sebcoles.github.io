# 🎤 Speaking & Events

I love sharing stories and practical insights from my adventures in **DevSecOps transformation** and **organisational change**, all in service of one goal: **protecting customer data**.

My talks are accessible and people-focused—they're **not technical deep-dives**, but instead highlight the *social, cultural, and leadership skills* needed to drive secure change in engineering organizations. Topics I regularly speak on include:

* Change Management & Influence
* Building and Leading Effective Teams
* Security Culture & Developer Engagement
* DevSecOps Roadmaps and Stakeholder Alignment

If you think your organisation or event could benefit from one of my sessions—**let’s chat!**
