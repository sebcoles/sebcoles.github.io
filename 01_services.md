### Partnering with CISOs to Enable Secure, Scalable Engineering

As a trusted ally to CISOs and security leaders, I work at the intersection of technology, product, and platform engineering to embed security without slowing down innovation. By collaborating closely with engineering teams, I help reduce security friction in the software development lifecycle (SDLC), address critical cyber risks, and foster alignment between information security and engineering. My award-winning work in this space has helped numerous organizationsâ€”and it can help yours too.

### DevSecOps Consulting Services

I offer end-to-end support for DevSecOps transformation initiativesâ€”from building the case for change and securing budgets to implementation, training, and reporting. Whether youâ€™re starting out or scaling up, I can support with

- Secure SDLC Maturity Assessments (BSIMM, SAMM, NIST SDF)
- Baseline Evaluations of organizational security posture

ðŸ’¡ Book a free, no-obligation 30-minute session to discuss your challenges and explore how I can help.

### Public Speaking & Workshops
I speak regularly at security and technology conferences, including as a keynote speaker, on topics spanning DevSecOps, organizational change, and professional growth. My sessions are tailored for your audience and can cover areas such as:
